        <h1>Code Calisthenics: Six Challenges</h1>
        <p>It's important that you're able to turn a logical problem into a code solution. In some form or another, this comes up frequently when you're building features with code. It's also a ripe target for interview questions. </p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Power</strong><br>
            Write a method <strong>power</strong> which takes two integers (base and exponent) and returns the base raised to the power of exponent.
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>Factorial</strong><br>
            Write a method <strong>factorial</strong> which takes a number and returns the product of every number up to the current number multiplied together.
        </li><br>    
        <li><strong>Uniques</strong><br>
            Write a method <strong>uniques</strong> which takes an array of items and returns the array without any duplicates. 
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>Combinations</strong><br>
            Write a method <strong>combinations</strong> which takes two arrays of strings and returns an array with all of the combinations of the items in them, listing the first items first.
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>Primes</strong><br>Write a method <strong>isPrime</strong> which takes in a number and returns true if it is a prime number. 
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>Rectangle Overlap</strong><br>Write a method <strong>overlap</strong> which takes two rectangles defined by the coordinates of their corners, e.g. [[0,0],[3,3]] and [[1,1],[4,6]], and determines whether they overlap. You can assume all coordinates are positive integers.
        </li><br>
            
        </ol>
