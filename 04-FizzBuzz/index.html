        <h1>FizzBuzz</h1>
        <p>Given an integer number N</p>
        <p>Your task is to write a function that prints to the standard output (stdout) the numbers from 1 to N (one per line) with the following restrictions</p> 
        
        <ul>for multiples of three print <strong>Fizz</strong> instead of the number</ul> <ul>for the multiples of five print <strong>Buzz</strong> instead of the number</ul> <ul>for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print <strong>FizzBuzz</strong></ul>
        
        <p>Note that your function will receive the following arguments <strong>n</strong> which is the integer number described above</p>
        
        <p>Data constraints: the maximum value of N will not exceed 1000</p>

<p>Efficiency constraints: your function is expected to print the result in less than 2 seconds</p>
