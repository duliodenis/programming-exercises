Programming Exercises
==============
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duliodenis/programming-exercises/master/art/fox-and-goose.jpg)

This repository is a collection of my solutions to classic programming exercises. They are mostly in C [just because](http://www.cprogramming.com/whyc.html).

Please take the time, without interruption, to try the exercises before looking at my solutions using the theory that greatness comes from practicing; applying the theory over and over again, using feedback to get better every time. 

If you have a better solution - let us all know with a pull request.
