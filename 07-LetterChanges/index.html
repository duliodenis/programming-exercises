        <h1>Letter Changes</h1>
        <p>For this challenge you will be manipulating characters in a string based off their positions in the alphabet. </p>
        
        <p>Replace every letter in the string with the letter following it in the alphabet (ie. c becomes d, z becomes a).<br> Then capitalize every vowel in this new string (a, e, i, o, u) and finally return this modified string. </p>
        
        See console.
